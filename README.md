# Spotify MiniDisc ðŸ’½ Playlist

Creates a Spotify playlist with [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) using the [Spotify Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/conradludgate/spotify/latest/docs) that inserts a track between all tracks in a playlist.

This is useful for when recording music to a [MiniDisc](https://www.minidisc.wiki) ðŸ’½ using [Synchro Rec](https://www.minidisc.wiki/guides/dubbing#synchro_rec) with a digital optical signal to automatically create track markers.

Can output artist, album, and track names for use in automatic TOC with something like [md-rec](https://github.com/fijam/md-rec).

## Requirements

This Terraform requires a modified version of `terraform-provider-spotify`, which you can build from https://github.com/ecliptik/terraform-provider-spotify in the `spotify_album_tracks` branch.

Follow [Create a Spotify Playlist with Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/spotify-playlist) for initial setup and configuration.

## Use

Get the Spotify Album ID by going to an llbum in Spotify, then `Share -> Copy Album Link` and extract the Album ID from the URL after `/album/`.

For example, the Album ID for Gunship - Dark All Day is `0rXLjiZSS0B7yYqCvz2akm`

Full Album URL
```
https://open.spotify.com/album/0rXLjiZSS0B7yYqCvz2akm
```

Pass this to `terrafrom` as the `album_id` variable,

```
terraform apply -var="album_id=0rXLjiZSS0B7yYqCvz2akm"
```

Example Output

```
ðŸ’½âžœ terraform apply -var="album_id=0rXLjiZSS0B7yYqCvz2akm"

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
